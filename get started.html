		The significance of voting in a democracy:
	</h1></b>
	<h2 align="center">
	Your Voice Matters 
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
– Voting isn’t just a formality, it’s your chance to choose leaders who represent your needs and values. The people in power make decisions that affect your education, healthcare, and future, so why not have a say?
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
	Democracy Only Works If You Participate 
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
	– A government should reflect the will of the people, but that only happens if people show up to vote. When fewer people vote, a small group decides for everyone else.
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
	Elections Bring Change 
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
– If you’re unhappy with how things are going, voting is your chance to push for change. Leaders and policies that align with your beliefs can make a real difference in your community.
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
	Every Vote Counts 
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
– You might think one vote doesn’t make a difference, but history proves otherwise. Some elections have been decided by just a handful of votes. Your vote has power!
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
	It Honors Those Who Fought for It 
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
– Not everyone has always had the right to vote. Many people fought hard for this privilege, and by voting, you’re making sure their struggles weren’t in vain.
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
	Make your voice heard—vote today and be part of the change you want to see.
